LiquidLib is a library mod created by andro951.  It doesn't add anything to the game by itself.

Allows mod creators to interact with liquid movement and liquid merges by making a GlobalLiquid class (exact same as any TMod Global class)

Example:
	Examples.ExampleGlobalLiquid.cs
	Shows off preventing liquids from moving or merging when near ancient copper bricks.

Please let me know if you'd like to make use of this mod or need help.

Please give us your feedback!!!!!!
